    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
      Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
      interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
      The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer
      Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called
      a web browser, and are published by a software application
      called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the
      Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and
      upon which technologies the Web is built.
      English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
      He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,
      Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to other research
      institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in
      August 1991. The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993-4, when websites
      for general use started to become available.[5] The World Wide Web has
      been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary
      tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[
