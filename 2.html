      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
     describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
     such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
     alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
     including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content
      accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
     of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
     formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which
     reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
     enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
     the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
    same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
     as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
     screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
     for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
    which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
     This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
